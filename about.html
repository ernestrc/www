				Born on March 11, 1989, in Girona, Spain, Ernest is a software engineer based in the US. In 2013, tired of his corporate job and spurred by his passion for creating things, he pivoted his career into software development. Since then, he's worked in several domains, from WebRTC signaling and media systems to logistics software <sup><a target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ernestrc">[1]</a></sup>.
